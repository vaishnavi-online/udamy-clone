Udemy-clone-
A clean and responsive Udemy-style webpage clone built using HTML and CSS with course cards, categories, and a contact form. This project is a Udamy Webpage Clone created using pure HTML and CSS. It recreates the look and feel of an e-learning platform with a focus on clean design, easy navigation, and responsive layouts. The homepage includes a custom navigation bar, category section, featured recommendations, popular course cards, and a structured footer. Hover effects, spacing, and visual hierarchy are used to make the UI more engaging.

Along with the main page, the project also includes a Contact Page featuring a simple and responsive contact form that allows users to submit their name, email, and message. This page highlights basic form styling and layout techniques with CSS.

This project is mainly created to practice front-end development, improve UI/UX understanding, and strengthen HTML/CSS skills.
